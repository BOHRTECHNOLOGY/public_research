# TSP for 3 nodes

## Introduction

The goal of this experiment was to tweak algorithm, so it will start working on the 3 nodes first.
However, due to long pause in development and possibly better solution to this problem I have abandonded this experiment.

All the files here are commited are work in progress, left here just as a reference.

## Dependencies

As a main engine for solving TSP I'm code from this repository: https://github.com/BOHRTECHNOLOGY/quantum_tsp, imported as a subtree.

I was using pyquil and grove.
Pyquil: commit hash: `c01ac52525d85b16cf7e11680cb1e54d86a7958f`
Grove: commit hash: `c1603ec3dff11755344ed8036d99541b0cbff93d`

The exact versions of these repositories are commited to this project.
