# Public research

This repository is created to store all the research done by Bohr.Technology that we decided to make publicly available.
It's also default place for research performed by people who are part of our bqResearch program (https://www.bohr.technology/bqresearcher).


## Structure

The repository consists of the following directories:

- Experiments - this is where the code of experiments performed for various projects is stored.
- Guidelines - place for storing guidelines describing our best practices.

## Contribution

If you would like to contribute make sure you read the guidelines. Also, it might be a good idea to contact ms@bohr.technology beforehand.
